# Codex CI Tools Documentation

This directory hosts in-depth references for contributors working with the shared CI automation suite. Use these guides to navigate the guard pipeline and automation workflow.

- [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) — Install the toolkit and integrate the shared Makefile.
- [`automation.md`](automation.md) — Run the Codex repair loop and interpret its phases.
- [`guard-suite.md`](guard-suite.md) — Explore every guard, their CLI flags, and enforcement policies.
- [`development.md`](development.md) — Local development workflow, release steps, and vendoring tips.

Add new documents alongside these references so the automation guard can surface them.
